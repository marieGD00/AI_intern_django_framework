# django_framework
I carried out this project as a machine learning intern for the Artificial intelligence start up NukkAI. We were given different forms data on crime in France and we were asked to clean the data and create a database with this data in order to query it, run visualisation, and later implement a machine learning framework in order to see whether or not this could help us predict crime in france in the future.
I developed a Django framework to streamline the filling in and querying of the database. 
I was also in charge of populating the database through the django framework from a csv file
