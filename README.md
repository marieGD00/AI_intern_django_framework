# django_framework
I carried out this project as a machine learning intern for the Artificial intelligence start up NukkAI who's goal is to use symbolic AI to create an AI that could beat the best player in bridge. One of their side projects was to create an AI to predict crime in different areas of france. In order to train the algorithm my task was to put together a database for which I developed a Django web Framework to streamline the filling in and querying of the database.
