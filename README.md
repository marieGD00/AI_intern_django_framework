# django_framework
I carried out this project as a machine learning intern for NukkAI. We were given data on crime and were asked to create a database with this data in order to query it, run visualisation, and later implement a machine learning framework in order to see whether or not this could help us predict crime in france in the future.
I developed a Django framework  to streamline the filling in and querying of the database.
